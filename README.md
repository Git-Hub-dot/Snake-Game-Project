- Replace the GitHub URL and email in the `README` if you plan to publish it online.
- You can rename the file to `README.md` and put it in your project folder so GitHub recognizes it.
- Add a screenshot in the project directory and update the image path if you'd like a preview.

Would you like me to generate a **GitHub repository structure** or **screenshot preview mockup** as well?
